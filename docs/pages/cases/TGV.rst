Taylor-Green Vortices
=====================
The Taylorâ€“Green Vortex (TGV) is a well-known benchmark in CFD, modelling the transition from an initially laminar state to a fully turbulent one. It is attractive as a test case due
to its simple setup, with the possibility to use a combination of
periodic and free-slip boundary conditions
